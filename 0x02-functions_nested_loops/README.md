what are loops? A Loop executes the sequence of statements many times until the
stated condition becomes false. A loop consists of two parts, a body of a loop
and a control statement. The control statement is a combination of some
conditions that direct the body of the loop to execute until the specified
condition becomes false. The purpose of the loop is to repeat the same code a
number of times.
