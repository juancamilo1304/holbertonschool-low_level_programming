Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential
collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collectiono
of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of
variables of the same type.

Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ...,
and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0],
numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific }
element in an array is accessed by an index.

All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address
corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element
